Federal employees and members of the public are encouraged to contribute to the project by [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and submitting a pull request. (If you are new to GitHub, you might start with a [basic tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git).) 

The easiest way for the uninitiated to commit is to simply navigate to [the main page in GitHub](https://github.com/benbalter/open-source-for-government/blob/gh-pages/index.md) and simply click edit. Note: if you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll be prompted to create one. The entire editing process will happen within your browser.

For a more nuanced editor, you can also try [prose.io](http://prose.io).
